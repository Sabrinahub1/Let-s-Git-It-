                        <p>
                            Pickles have a very long history and are found across 
                            all cultures. Pickles have been around for 
                            thousands of years and cucumbers from their native India 
                            were pickled in the Tigris Valley. <br>The word 
                            “pickle” comes from the Dutch pekel or northern German 
                            pókel, meaning “salt” or “brine,” two very important 
                            components in the pickling process.
                            <br>The earliest known examples are cucumbers that are known to have been pickled some time around 2030 BC in Mesopotamia, when inhabitants from northern India brought cucumber seeds to the Tigris valley.
