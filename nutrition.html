               Who does not like pickles? Pickles are spicy, sweet, tangy, delicious and a great snack at anytime. However, eating too much of anything can be harmful to your body. As tasty as they are they also cause some unwanted conditions to your health.<br>
               Most of the pickles are usually made with a lot of oil, spices, vinegar and salt.  Packaged pickles, are meant to be able to last on a shelf for sometime therefore they will be full of oil, salt, vinegar, sugar and preservatives. Next, several pickles are also high on sugar content which may not be good for people who have diabetes. Packaged pickles are loaded with preservatives that can increase the triglyceride levels in your body. High triglyceride levels can be a bad news for your health as they can lead to risk of several health problems. (www.healthline.com/, Natalie Butler, RD, LD )
